The Real MVP
Farnam brings all the students to the yard and we’re like, it’s better than subes
He’s gonna teach you but he’ll have to charge 2.9% more next year
The hero we need but don't deserve
All hail Lord Farnam
Our glorious leader Farnam Jahanian
Farnam in the streets but Subs in the sheets
Did someone ask for tents?
Is there a CFA lawn? Not anymore
I don’t usually pick favorites, but when I do, they’re named Farnam

I’m not a regular president. I’m a cool president.
one does not simply free the UC stones
On Wednesdays we wear kilts
Are you not entertained?
Much Farnival, Such booth
Green and grass? More like belongs in the trash
